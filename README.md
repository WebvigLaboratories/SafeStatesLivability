# SafeStates Livability & Smart Growth Database
Hosted by the Safe States Alliance, the Livability & Smart Growth Assessment Tools Database provides centralized access to basic assessment tools and checklists that can assist users with evaluating their communities' degree of livability and provide essential information needed to create safer and healthier neighborhoods.

The tools within this database are searchable by community size, assessment type, user role, and six topic areas developed as a practical combination of the Livability and Smart Growth principles.
